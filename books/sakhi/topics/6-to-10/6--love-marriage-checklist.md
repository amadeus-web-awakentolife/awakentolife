## Love marriage? Check more than just compatibility!

* Love topples logic - that being said, what are the basic non-negotiables that will bring family acceptance and bridge the cultural gap if any?
* What is each ones financial alignment - beliefs on saving, spending, balance of both, charity, joint accounts, joint spending heads etc.
* Are you an expressive person? Have you checked the expectations of your partner in terms of expressive love?.
* Have you attended premarital counseling as a couple? Was it useful?
